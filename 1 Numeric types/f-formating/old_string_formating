#object frendly
hero = {'name':'Ze', 'bodycount':0}
print("Hello, {name}, stop being lazy and go fuck more than {bodycount}".format(name=hero['name'],bodycount=hero['bodycount']))

#Conclusion, 1st one is garbage, 2nd one is decent but with everything that's not in dictionary form it's easy to make mistakes and can take a lot of time if there are lots of parameters
